			<h1>Surface<br>Art</h1>
			<p>1.	Art can be made by anyone anywhere.<br>
			2.	The belief that art needs a message to be<br> good is wrong.<br>
			3.	Art can be appreciated at the surface and does<br>not<br>need to contain a hidden message.<br>
			4.	Make Art for the fun of it.<br>
			5.	Donâ€™t think too hard about it.<br>
			6.	Art with the purpose for enjoyment is the best art.<br>
			7.	Make art you think will be cool.<br>
