			<h1>OK Art</h1>
			<p>1. "OK art" is an OK idea, --not great, but not bad either.<br>

2. OK artists make OK art.<br>

3. OK artists really want to make great art, they shoot for the stars, but<br>
their work ends up being just OK. OK artists are OK with this.<br>

4. Art enthusiasts and cynics alike, leave an OK art exhibition saying
"that was OK". No one is blown away but they don't feel cheated either.<br>

5. OK art will probably not make it into art history; although someone in
the future might find an OK artwork and think "this isn't so bad."<br>

6. "Different" and "interesting" are two adjectives often overheard at OK
art exhibitions.<br>

7. OK artists are OK with bad reviews, but naturally they prefer good
reviews and they keep those and post them on the internet.<br>

8. It's a good idea to call yourself an OK artist before somebody else
does.<br>

9. Ambitious, megalomaniac artists feel great relief when they accept
they're just OK.<br>

10. OK ideas are defended passionately but not more than that.<br>

11. (this point was erased during editing)<br>

12. OK art is unlikely to be over or underrated.<br>

13. We hate artists that are A-OK, those bastards!<br>

14. There is no point in making an OK art movement, although fleeting
consideration of the concept would be OK.<br>
